# We need the following:

# - fcgiwrap, because that is how nginx does CGI
# - spawn-fcgi, to launch fcgiwrap and to create the unix socket
# - nginx, because it is our frontend

COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# launch fcgiwrap via spawn-fcgi; launch nginx in the foreground
# so the container doesn't die on us; supposedly we should be
